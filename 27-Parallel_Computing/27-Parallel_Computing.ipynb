    "## What is parallelism?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional algorithms use serial computation, which means that instructions are processed one after the others. These algorithms are easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallelism** is the approach of executing multiple threads simultaneously. This can be applied to anything. For example, it is common that GUI applications have a thread for the user interface and a separate thread for any back-end processing (saving a file, running a computation), which ensures that the user interface stays responsive while the back-end processing is active. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel computing** is when a computational task is broken into smaller subtasks, which are processed simultaneously and indpendently. \n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need parallelism? Speed! The benefits of parallel computing are that either larger tasks can be completed that couldn't be completed in reasonable time on a single CPU, or that tasks can be completed faster. \n",

    "## The Rise of Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Parellism has always been important, but it is becoming increasingly relevant. Two decades ago, we could rely on increasing CPU speeds to make computation faster and faster. [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) states that the number of transistors in a chip doubles approximately every two years. And more transistors (naively) equals more computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Moore's Law](moores_law.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to about 2004 this also correlated with an increase in speed for a single CPU core by increasing it's clock speed (number of instructions computed per second). However, since then it hasn't been possible to further increase clock speed for various technical reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Clock Speed](clock_speed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of making individual CPUs faster, we are adding more CPUs on a single Chip. However, having multiple processors doesn't make a single thread faster. Hence, we increasingly need parallelism to leverage the speed advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a larger scale, we can also distribute workload amonst multiple computers, e.g., in a computer clusters. Also, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are now used for a wide variety of tasks, because of their ability to run many processes in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A Programmers Perspective.** Question: How do you make your program run faster? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer before 2004: Wait 6 months and buy a new computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer after 2004: You need to write parallel software."

    "data set is very large, so it is stored once, but may be used for many different purposes.\n",
    "The mapping phase takes a file, and converts it into another set of key-value pairs. The values generally\n",
